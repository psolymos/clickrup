> Interacting with the ClickUp v2 API from R

[ClickUp](https://clickup.com/?noRedirect=true) is a cloud-based collaboration and project management tool. 
Features include tasks, docs, chat, goals, and [more](https://clickup.com/features).

The {clickrup} R package wraps the ClickUp [API v2](https://clickup.com/api). 
See the [roadmap](https://github.com/psolymos/clickrup/issues/1) for what is currently included in the package.

## Setup

Install the {clickrup} package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## using remotes
remotes::install_github("psolymos/clickrup")

## with r-universe
options(repos = c(
    psolymos = "https://psolymos.r-universe.dev",
    CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
install.packages('clickrup')
```

Follow this [tutorial](https://docs.clickup.com/en/articles/1367130-getting-started-with-the-clickup-api):

- sign up for ClickUp (you can use this referral [link](https://clickup.com?fp_ref=peter51) to do so, it's free),
- navigate to your personal *Settings*,
- click *Apps* in the left sidebar,
- click *Generate* to create your API token,
- click *Copy* to copy the token to your clipboard.

Now add your ClickUp token as an environment variable:

- open the file `.Renviron`: `file.edit("~/.Renviron")`,
- add a line with `CU_PAT="your_token"` to the `.Renviron` file and save it,
- check with `Sys.getenv("CU_PAT")`, it should return the token.

The ClickUp token will look something like 
`pk_4753994_EXP7MPOJ7XQM5UJDV2M45MPF0YHH5YHO`.

The `cu_set_pat` function uses `Sys.setenv` to set
the `CU_PAT` environment variable for other processes called from within R or future calls to `Sys.getenv` from the same R process.

## API endpoints

The first step you want to do is to get the IDs for your workspaces (teams is the legacy term for this in the API):

If your setup was successful, `cu_get_teams()` should return a list with the workspace IDs and names.

The easiest way to get going with the various endpoints is to browse the [API v2 documentation](https://clickup.com/api).
Once you found what you are after, just look at the API heading. There is **Get Teams**, the R function
is prepended with `cu_` (to facilitate RStudio code completion), 
then comes the heading in lower case and spaces replaced by underscores.
For example **Get Filtered Team Tasks** will be `cu_get_filtered_team_tasks()`.
Articles (a, an, the) are dropped (e.g. **Create a Time Entry**)
will be `cu_create_time_entry()`.

Function arguments are the *Parameters* listed on the API page, `...` passes optional parameters, query parameters, 
or elements for the body.

## Examples

Load the package and set the access token if it is not already set.
`cu_get_pat()` returns the token invisibly, so it doesn't
end up in logs.

```{r}
library(clickrup)
cu_get_pat() # returns PAT invisibly
```

### ClikUp hierarchy

The [ClickUp hierarchy](https://docs.clickup.com/en/articles/1045623-how-does-the-hierarchy-structure-work-in-clickup) includes the following levels:

- Workspaces (teams is the legacy term for this in the API)
- Spaces
- Folders
- Lists
- Tasks
- Subtasks
- Checklists

We can list Workspaces that we have access to using the `cu_get_teams()`
function. It takes no arguments, it only passes the access token
behind the scenes, so it is a good way to test if things are
working as expected

```{r}
Teams <- cu_get_teams()
str(Teams, 3)
```

Spaces within a specific Workspace defined by its `team_id`

```{r}
team_id <- Teams$teams[[2]]$id
Spaces <- cu_get_spaces(team_id)
str(Spaces, 3)
```

Folders within a specific Space defined by its `space_id`

```{r}
space_id <- Spaces$spaces[[2]]$id
Folders <- cu_get_folders(space_id)
str(Folders, 3)
```

Lists within a specific Folder defined by its `folder_id`
(or Folderless Lists based on `space_id`)

```{r}
folder_id <- Folders$folders[[1]]$id
Lists <- cu_get_lists(folder_id)
str(Lists, 3)

cu_get_lists_folderless(space_id)
```

The functions `cu_get_spaces`, `cu_get_folders`, and `cu_get_lists`
accept the argument `archived` to return archived spaces/folders/lists

```{r}
str(cu_get_lists(folder_id, archived=TRUE), 3)
```

### Tasks

We can list Tasks within a specific List defined by its `list_id`

```{r}
list_id <- Lists$lists[[1]]$id
Tasks <- cu_get_tasks(list_id)
str(Tasks, 2)
```

Notice that we have `r length(Tasks$tasks)` tasks in the list.
We can include Subtasks too

```{r}
subTasks <- cu_get_tasks(list_id, subtasks=TRUE)
length(subTasks$tasks)
```

Getting all the tasks (possibly filtered) in a Workspace
is done via the `cu_get_filtered_team_tasks` function.
This function returns tasks in batches of 100.
If you don't want to deal with paging, use the
wrapper function `cu_get_all_team_tasks`
The list of tasks returned does not include closed tasks,
to get those as well we need to pass the `include_closed`
query parameter

```{r}
## without closed tasks
length(cu_get_all_team_tasks(team_id, subtasks=TRUE)$tasks)

## with closed tasks
allSubTasks <- cu_get_all_team_tasks(team_id, subtasks=TRUE,
                                include_closed=TRUE)
length(allSubTasks$tasks)

Status <- sapply(allSubTasks$tasks, function(z) z$status$status)
data.frame(table(Status))
```

Let's inspect the first few elements of a Task object

```{r}
str(Tasks$tasks[[1]][1:10])
```

Dates are given as Unix time (in milliseconds),
`cu_date_from` and `cu_date_to` is there to convert back and forth

```{r}
Tasks$tasks[[1]]$date_created
cu_date_from(Tasks$tasks[[1]]$date_created)
cu_date_to(cu_date_from(Tasks$tasks[[1]]$date_created))
```

A single task can be accessed through the task ID
(note: copying the task ID from the ClickUp GUI will prepend
the task ID by a hash, `"#8ckjp5"`, but the API expects
ID without the hash `"8ckjp5"`). Use the `cu_task_id` function to get
rid of the leading hash (all API call use this function to
normalize task IDs).

The `$parent` property is `NULL` for Tasks, and 
it contains the parent Task ID for Subtasks

```{r}
x1 <- cu_get_task(cu_task_id("#8ckjp5")) # task
x1$parent

x2 <- cu_get_task("8ckjru") # subtask
x2$parent
```

Dependencies are stored in the `$dependencies` property

```{r}
str(x1$dependencies)
```

### Helper functions

`cu_options` stores the API settings

```{r}
str(cu_options())
```

`cu_response` allows inspecting the response object

```{r}
cu_response(Teams)
```

Check rate limits and remaining requests (rate is limited by the minute)

```{r}
cu_ratelimit(subTasks)
```

### Formatting the request body

`PUSH` and `PUT` requests often require to send data as part of the
request body. Check the API examples and use `I()` when the API expects an
array as part of the body. For example when passing data to
`cu_create_task`, `assignees` is an array of the assignees' 
userids to be added. Adding a single userid without `I()` will
drop the brackets, but
`list(name = "New Task Name", assignees = I(183))` will result in
the expected JSON object:
`{ "name": "New Task Name", "assignees": [183] }`.

### Attachments

We can upload files as attachments to tasks:

```{r eval=FALSE}
f <- file.path(tempdir(), "example.png")

png(f)
hist(rnorm(10^6), col=2, main="Example")
dev.off()

cu_post_task_attachment("8ach57", f)

unlink(f) # delete file
```
